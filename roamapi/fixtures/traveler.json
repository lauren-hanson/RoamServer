            "bio": "I've been living the RV lifestyle for a few years now, traveling around the country and playing music wherever I go. It's been an amazing experience, and I feel so lucky to be able to combine my love of music with my passion for travel. One of the best things about traveling in an RV is the flexibility it gives me. I can go wherever the wind takes me, and if I find a spot I really like, I can stay there as long as I want. I've seen some incredible sights on my travels, from the mountains of Colorado to the beaches of California, and I feel like I've really gotten to know this country in a way that I never could have otherwise. Of course, there are some challenges that come with living on the road. It can be tough to find reliable internet and cell service sometimes, which makes it hard to stay connected with friends and family. And while I love playing music in different places, it can also be tough to find gigs in new towns and cities. But overall, I wouldn't trade this lifestyle for anything. I love waking up every day not knowing where I'll be sleeping that night, and I love the sense of freedom that comes with being able to take my home with me wherever I go. And of course, getting to share my music with new audiences all over the country is an incredible feeling that I'm grateful for every day.",

I spent months outfitting the van with a bed, kitchenette, and other amenities that would allow me to live comfortably on the road. I spend several weeks each year traveling to different parts of the country, seeking out beautiful landscapes and unique cultural experiences to capture on film. I love the freedom and flexibility of being able to go wherever my camera takes me, whether that's filming wildlife in national parks or documenting local traditions in small towns.",
