The freedom and flexibility of being able to go wherever the road takes me, whether that's camping in national parks or exploring small towns off the beaten path. I enjoy meeting new people along the way and learning about different cultures and ways of life.",

I spent months outfitting the van with a bed, kitchenette, and other amenities that would allow me to live comfortably on the road. I spend several weeks each year traveling to different parts of the country, seeking out beautiful landscapes and unique cultural experiences to capture on film. I love the freedom and flexibility of being able to go wherever my camera takes me, whether that's filming wildlife in national parks or documenting local traditions in small towns.",

We drive all over the place, from the mountains to the beaches, and everywhere in between. We hike, swim, and explore new places every day.",
